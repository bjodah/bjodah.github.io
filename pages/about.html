  <p> I'm currently a second year PhD student in
      the Department of Chemistry at <a href="http://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>. I work with
      <a href="http://www.kth.se/en/che/divisions/tfk/staff/seniors/jonsson-1.79948">Mats Jonsson</a> and <a href="http://www.kth.se/en/che/divisions/tfk/staff/seniors/brinck-1.80061">Tore Brinck</a> on interfacial radiation chemistry.

<h2 class="entry-title">Research</h2>
<p> My research project at KTH
    aims to develop better models for chemical processes at surfaces
    between water and metals/metal oxides driven by ionizing radiation.
    In the study of these phenomena I often need to test a model by
    formulating it mathematically and solving it numerically using
    a combination of own specially written software and standard numerical
    libraries.</p>
<p> In order the get information on how fast a proposed chemical process is
    I turn to quantum chemistry. By doing ab initio modelling of small molecular
    models you can get energetics of a reaction accurate enough to predict
    kinetic parameters.</p>
<p> The software that I write are publicly available on 
  <a href="http://github.com/bjodah">github</a>. The reason for why I publish
    it there is threefold:
<ul>
 <li> Reproducibility
 <li> Other scientists are welcome to use and improve upon that software.
 <li> Publicly funded research
</ul>
