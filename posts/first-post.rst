Finally a new website!

As many others, I composed a few personal websites in the
late 90's early 2000's just using straight HTML in Notepad.
It was a fun pastime, but it was more about
technical design than actual content, and pretty soon I realized this
and took it down. But I have meant to reinstate my web presence
for a while, and since I am now since soon two years doing a PhD
I will, if time permits, write about some of the more general
problems (and their solution) popping up as I am striving forward.

To expand my technical remarks about webpages: I just have to point
you to `Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_,
which is a static site generator written in Python and which is what
I've used to generate this site. 

The source for this site is hosted at `github <http://github.com/bjodah/bjodah.github.io/tree/source>`_.
The setup is a derivative of `rmcgibbo's <https://github.com/rmcgibbo>`_ work
on his `professional website <https://github.com/rmcgibbo/rmcgibbo.org>`_. And when
speaking of Pelican blogs, I also must mention `Jake VanderPlas <http://jakevdp.github.io/>`_,
who is an influential person in the scientific python community, who is
hosting a quite terrific blog for showing what you can do with Pelican.
