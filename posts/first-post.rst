Finally a new website!

As many others, I composed a few personal websites in the
late 90's early 2000's just using straight HTML in Notepad.
It was a fun pastime, but it was more about
design than actual content, and pretty soon I realized this
and took it down. But I have meant to reinstate my web presence
for a while, and since I am now since soon two years doing a PhD
I will, if time permits, write about some of the more general
problems (and their solution) popping up as I am striving forward.

For the underlying technology of the website I just have to point
you in the direction of `Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_,
which is a static site generator written in Python. 

The source for this site is hosted at `github <http://github.com/bjodah/bjodah.github.io/tree/source>`_
. The setup is a derivative of `rmcgibbo's <https://github.com/rmcgibbo>`_ work
on his `professional website <https://github.com/rmcgibbo/rmcgibbo.org>`_.

One influential person in the scientific python community which has a good
blog showing what you can do with Pelican is `Jake VanderPlas <http://jakevdp.github.io/>`_.
