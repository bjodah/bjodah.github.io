I am now since a little more than two years doing a PhD in Chemistry
with focus on radiation induced processes at the solid/water interface.

On this blog I hope to - if time permits - write about some of the
problems of more general interest (and their solution) popping up as I
am striving forward.

On a technical note, this blog is staticially generated using `Pelican
<http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_ . The source for this site is hosted
at `github <http://github.com/bjodah/bjodah.github.io/tree/source>`_.
The setup is a derivative of `rmcgibbo's <https://github.com/rmcgibbo>`_ work
on his `professional website <https://github.com/rmcgibbo/rmcgibbo.org>`_. And when
speaking of Pelican blogs, I also must mention `Jake VanderPlas
<http://jakevdp.github.io/>`_, who is an influential person in the
scientific python community, who is hosting a quite terrific blog for
showing what you can do with Pelican.
